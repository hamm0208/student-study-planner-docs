The frontend is implemented using **Next.js** and resides mainly in the following directories:  
  - *`src/app/view`*  
    - Contains the **page-level views** for different modules (Students, Units, Courses, etc.).  
    - Each subfolder maps to a route in the application.
```
src/app/view/
	├── unit 
		├── component_1.js
		├── component_2.js
```

  - *`src/components`*  
    - Reusable **UI components** such as buttons, popup alert modals.  
    - Promotes modularity and consistency across the app.  
```
src/components/
	├── button.js
	├── nav.js
	├── popup.js 
```

  - *`src/styles`*  
    - Global and module-specific stylesheets.  
    - Contains CSS/Tailwind customization for consistent design.  
```
src/styles/
	├── unit.module.css
	├── course.module.css	 
```

  - *`public/`*  
    - Static assets like images, icons, and other files that are directly served by the application.
