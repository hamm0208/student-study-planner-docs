Organized by feature area, each folder contains the pages and UI logic for that part of the system.

- **course/** → Course management screens
    
- **dashboard/** → Main landing and overview screens
    
- **search_student_study_planner/** → Search functionality for planners
    
- **student_information/** → Student details and records
    
- **terms/** → Term management pages
    
- **unit/** → Unit management screens
    
- **unit_type/** → Unit classification and categorization
    

These map directly to **API routes** and **domain classes**, keeping backend and frontend aligned.
