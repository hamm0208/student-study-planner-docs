#### **Implementation Details**

For each module, Jest tests were written to:

- **Mock external dependencies** such as API calls and database interactions using the `fetch` mock and Prisma mocking.
    
- **Validate core functionalities** including data retrieval, insertion, and update logic.
    
- **Test error handling and edge cases** to ensure robust and predictable behavior.
    
- **Verify return values and data structures** using assertions like `expect(result).toEqual(...)` or property-based checks.
    
- **Reset mock states** after each test (`afterEach()`) to ensure test isolation.
    

Mock hoisting, ES module compatibility, and path mapping were carefully configured to resolve module import issues. The final stable configuration involved:

- Moving all `jest.mock()` calls before imports.
    
- Adjusting module paths to relative references (e.g., `../../../utils/db/db.js`).
    
- Adding `__esModule: true` in mocks for ES module support.
    
- Ensuring the `jest.config.cjs` correctly specified the environment as `'jest-environment-jsdom'`.
