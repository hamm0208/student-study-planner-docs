## System Goal

The Student Study Planner is designed to **streamline the course planning process** primarily for Head of Departments(HODs) in respective faculties. It replaces the static, document-based planner with an interactive, adaptable system that:

- **Centralizes course planning information** so students and staff can access accurate data in real time.
    
- **Supports multiple user groups** (students, Heads of Department, administrators) by providing tailored features for each role within the course-planning process.
    
- **Resolves scheduling and progression conflicts faster**, reducing the need for manual intervention.
    

### Problem Addressed

The existing study planner is provided as a **downloadable document** on the university website. It:

- Lacks flexibility to reflect updates or changes in course progression.
    
- Forces students to consult the Head of Department (HOD), who must resolve issues manually using fragmented tools.
    
- Results in a time-consuming process that delays accurate academic guidance and increases administrative workload.
    

By digitizing and automating the planner, the new system delivers **real-time adaptability**, **greater efficiency**, and **improved communication** between students and academic staff.
