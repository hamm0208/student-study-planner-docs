System testing was conducted to ensure the Student Study Planner System works correctly as a whole.  
The main goals and activities included:

- Verifying that all modules (Course, Study Planner, User Profile, Permissions, etc.) work together smoothly.
    
- Checking data flow and interaction between system components.
    
- Detecting logic errors, integration issues, or broken connections after combining modules.
    
- Confirming that the system meets functional requirements before deployment.
    
- Using both **feature testing** (manual) and **Jest testing** (automated) to ensure accuracy and reliability.
